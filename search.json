    "text": "Project Description\nFor your final project (which will take the place of the final exam), you will be recording a screencast in the style of David Robinson‚Äôs TidyTuesday screencasts.\nYou can find time-stamped, catalogued versions of some of David Robinson‚Äôs screencasts here.\nRequirements:\n\nYour screencast should be approximately 45 minutes long.\nYour screencast should show your analysis of a TidyTuesday dataset from 2023\nYou should showcase at least 4 different techniques you‚Äôve learned in Stat 251. Some examples include:\n\ndata cleaning (dplyr) verbs\nreshaping data (tidyr)\nworking with dates and times (lubridate)\nworking with strings (stringr)\nwriting functions to modularize your code\nvisualizing your data effectively\n\n\nUnlike David Robinson‚Äôs screencasts, you will write a rough pseudocode ‚Äúscript‚Äù before you start recording. This will give you a rough outline of how to do the analysis and what things you intend to cover.\nYour goal is to help a future Stat 251 student understand some of the topics covered in this class. So while David Robinson and others who record their screencasts live might not fully explain what he‚Äôs doing, you should take the time to explain each technique you decide to use in a way that will help someone else understand.\nThere will be three deliverables for this project:\n\nPlan your dataset and topics\nPseudocode script uploaded to github repository\nScreencast + github repository\n\nScreencast uploaded to YouTube/YuJa\nApproximate time index provided for each of the 4 techniques you‚Äôre demonstrating (examples)\nCode uploaded to github repository\n\n\nIn lieu of the final exam, you will peer review two classmates‚Äô screencasts."
